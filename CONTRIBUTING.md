# Contributing to Copilot Session Dashboard

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This document explains how to get involved.

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful and constructive. We're all here to build something useful.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

Open an [issue](https://github.com/JeffSteinbok/ghcpCliSessionDashboard/issues) with:
- A clear description of the problem
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs. actual behavior
- Your OS, Python version, and package version

### Suggesting Features

Open an [issue](https://github.com/JeffSteinbok/ghcpCliSessionDashboard/issues) with the `enhancement` label and describe what you'd like and why.

### Submitting Code

1. **Fork** the repository and create your branch from `main`:
   ```
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
   ```
2. Make your changes following the [development guide](DEVELOPMENT.md).
3. Ensure all CI checks pass (lint, type check, tests).
4. **Open a Pull Request** against `main` — direct pushes to `main` are not allowed.
5. A maintainer will review your PR. Please be patient and responsive to feedback.

## Branch Policy

- `main` is protected. All changes must come through a Pull Request.
- Branch names should follow the pattern: `feat/`, `fix/`, `chore/`, `docs/` as a prefix.
- Keep PRs focused — one feature or fix per PR.

## Development Setup

See [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) for instructions on setting up a local dev environment.
